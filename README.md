# AAI Loaders: Reduced Costs

Makes all loaders created by [Earendel's AAI Loaders](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/aai-loaders) mod
cheaper to craft, by changing their recipes to only require a few materials.

## Details

- AAI Loaders is forced into the "expensive" unlubricated mode, to ensure none of the lubricant supply scripting is executed.
- Unlubricated recipes adjusted to cost 5x Inserters and 5x Belts, of an appropriate tier.

## Special thanks

- Wube, for the awesome game
- Earendel, for awesome standalone loaders mod
